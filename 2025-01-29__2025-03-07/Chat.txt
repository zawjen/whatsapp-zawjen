2/1/25, 4:23 PM - Rafey: I worked today on building a tool to extract arabic text from pdf. i will provide zawjen team this tool to create text, images and upload all pdf, images and text to GitHub. 

Once we have text, we will proof read to make it accurate.

Our path of building reliable datasets is PDF->Text/Image->Proof Read->Json->Release for Zawjen

As a first project we are building AnalyzeQuran kind of product using following dictionaries. So each word of Quran will be shown with a meaning available in selected dictionaries...


Here is a list of popular Arabic dictionaries for the Quran, with their names in Arabic:

المعاني (Al-Ma'ani)
لسان العرب (Lisan al-Arab) by ابن منظور (Ibn Manzur)
القاموس المحيط (Al-Qamoos al-Muheet) by الفيروزابادي (Al-Firuzabadi)
المنجد (Al-Munjid) by شركة المكتبة البولسية (Al-Maktabah al-Bulusiya)
الصحاح في اللغة (Al-Sihah fi al-Lughah) by الجوهري (Al-Jawhari)
مفردات ألفاظ القرآن (Mufradat Alfaz al-Quran) by الراغب الأصفهاني (Al-Raghib al-Isfahani)
2/1/25, 5:12 PM - Razi Ur Rehman: I m following Zawjen project on Github. 

If there is any operational work that I can help, since I am not technical person (no coding skills) 

But I m with you.
2/1/25, 6:55 PM - Rafey: Yes, let me give you a tool... Please download the above dictionaries in pdf from the archive.org... we will create one GitHub repo for each dataset or book in format ds-[book name]
2/1/25, 6:56 PM - Rafey: Gather as much as people you can manage for dataset and proof reading work
2/1/25, 6:59 PM - Rafey: Each GitHub repo will have following folders

1. pdf
2. png
3. txt
4. json

All in lower case. Once we have json, we will release it to zawjen.net
2/1/25, 7:04 PM - Rafey: We will download pure Arabic pdf books with beat quality published from Beruit if possible <This message was edited>

2/2/25, 9:30 AM - Razi Ur Rehman: These dictionaries would be Arabic to Arabic? or Arabic to English?
2/2/25, 10:16 AM - Rafey: Arabic to Arabic

2/9/25, 4:18 PM - Rafey: In this phase of the project, we are converting pdf Arabic dictionaries into JSON dataset.

We are using Python to extract Arabic images from PDF of each page, its text and Json representation. 

This dataset will be released open source at https://github.com/zawjen

There is a possibility of a million such datasets.

Our web and mobile team will make it searchable through filters.

Our data science team will apply Red, Green and Yellow attributes.

Our Proof reading team will monitor the quality of datasets.

Together we will make people around the world to see a custom knowledge for any area in the world may it be religious, political, historical, medical or engineering.

Our media teams will create content from Green knowledge to children, adults and elderly.

We create content that uplift communities around the world. Bring them closer in nature like a river, sea or mountain. We will bring the best life to everyone through the collective heritage of knowledge.

May Allah help us all. Ameen

2/12/25, 4:08 AM - Rafey: *Important*

1. This is a *Sadqah e Jariyha* work. Word 'Sidqh' means Truth. You do sadqah once a day, once a week or once a month. And that is okay as long as it is with a truthful heart i.e *Sincerity*. 
2. We do jobs, raise family. Sadqah should not interfere with your primary responsibilities for example a job. Do not use your office laptop, mobile, internet, electricity, chair, pen or paper to do this Sadqah. Do it with your own things, and in your spare  time.
3. It is a life long activity, so do it calmly and softly.

May Allah give you strength and bless you <This message was edited>

I wanted to add a Teams page in our website. Could you share in a private message to me similar details of your journey in a word document.
2/13/25, 10:45 AM - Farukh React Zaw: Noted
2/13/25, 10:50 AM - Farukh React Zaw: https://swagger.io/docs/
2/13/25, 10:53 AM - Rafey: Thanks Farukh for sharing. I will review it with GitHub Postman repo for REST API specifications, authentication and automation for all teams.
2/13/25, 11:02 AM - Rafey: React and React native or mobile developers, please share your thoughts and experience on the following:


For a data-heavy app like zawjen.net with advanced search and filtering, Ant Design (antd) is a great choice for the web, as it provides powerful table components (Table, List, TreeSelect), pagination, and search filters. 

For React Native, it's best to use React Native Paper or React Native Elements for optimal performance. Or Ant Design Mobile (antd-mobile) is also good?
2/13/25, 11:12 AM - Hafeez Shaikh Zaw: NextJs,
Has powerful tooling for ssr and routing.
For components I would suggest Shadcn library.
2/13/25, 11:14 AM - Farukh React Zaw: React is provides some features for optimizations like useCallback, useMemo, memo and React window package for large data for table in the aspect of Virtualization etc. <This message was edited>
2/13/25, 11:15 AM - Hafeez Shaikh Zaw: For mobile.
Ant-D mobile is outdated for now.
Paper and elements both are good. But when we'll be able to choose after UI is done.
2/13/25, 11:17 AM - Farukh React Zaw: I created custom advance filter with Ant Design library with dynamic form approach in the project
2/13/25, 11:20 AM - Hafeez Shaikh Zaw: Plus
SSR is a must for data heavy apps.

Advance search filtering depends a lot on routing also.
2/13/25, 11:22 AM - Farukh React Zaw: Yes NextJS is best option
2/13/25, 11:30 AM - Farukh React Zaw: https://web.dev/articles/virtualize-long-lists-react-window
2/13/25, 11:31 AM - Rafey: UI will be like LinkedIn job filter or pakwheels filter or Facebook search and filter.

I would say pakwheels.com to start with
2/13/25, 11:34 AM - Rafey: Why SSR is must for data heavey search and filter apps?

It would require us to pay lots of sever processing cost right?

Why simple React website calling REST API  returning JSON will not work.

SSR is good when you need SEO?
2/13/25, 11:35 AM - Rafey: Is it clean? I mean does antd keeps your code clean? Or make it messey?
2/13/25, 11:36 AM - Farukh React Zaw: I have done in the ERP project in the past
2/13/25, 11:37 AM - Farukh React Zaw: Yes I follow the best practices for code
2/13/25, 11:38 AM - Farukh React Zaw: I will give you small demo with a video after my office hours from home.
2/13/25, 11:40 AM - Zain Ul Abdeen ReactNative Zaw: React is fine. We will use server-side pagination and filtration wherever required
2/13/25, 11:44 AM - Rafey: Thanks for your input Zain. You can imagine that our website is like Wikipedia so it requires good SEO... But at the same time it very data search and filter heavy website.

Which one you will select NextJs or React?
2/13/25, 11:44 AM - Rafey: Thanks for your kind input. Sure, let's have a demo of clean code during weekends
2/13/25, 11:46 AM - Farukh React Zaw: One problem is in React with SEO and built-in one thing is not in the React we requires an additional package for SEO React-Helmet for SEO purposes.
2/13/25, 11:55 AM - Farukh React Zaw: React Helmet is only provides few options for meta tags, title and description etc for each page but it is not effective solution.
2/13/25, 11:56 AM - Farukh React Zaw: React JS is good option for admin panels: Hotel booking system, logistics, ERP system.
2/13/25, 12:04 PM - Hafeez Shaikh Zaw: For nextjs. Seo is not a issue
2/13/25, 12:05 PM - Hafeez Shaikh Zaw: Jab hum server side use kerte hein. To SEO khud hi perfomant hojati he
2/13/25, 12:05 PM - Rafey: Yes I have a thought of NextJs as well for SSR and SEO... I think it is heavy on our pocket and cost more... But our use case is SEO heavy
2/13/25, 12:06 PM - Rafey: Thanks Hafeez for your kind insights. Love it 💚
2/13/25, 12:06 PM - Farukh React Zaw: I agree with your point
2/13/25, 12:06 PM - Rafey: Great insights. Love it 💚
2/13/25, 12:08 PM - Zain Ul Abdeen ReactNative Zaw: Well in that case we can go for next js, next js have both options csr and ssr, we can choose component wise

2/13/25, 12:21 PM - Rafey: NextJs now seems very natural and logical choice. If everyone agrees:

1. Zawjen.net will be developed using NextJs and Shadcn due to data, search, filter, SEO, content heavy website with billions of pages like medium.com or wikipedia.com
2. For zawjen admin website we will use same NextJs and Shadcn
3. For zawjen mobile app we will use React native and papper
4. TypeScript everywhere
5. Jest for unit test
6. NestJs Node for backend APIs
7. GitHub api-contract repo for Postman REST API request response JSON, QA automation, frontend testing, backend testing, API documentation, automatic authentication 
8. Kuberneets for service clustering
9. GitHub project for tickets assignment 
10. Markdown to write requirements 
11. OKR and Scrum as process
12. Google Meet for screen sharing calls
13. GitHub organization repo to define engineering and non engineering processes
14. GitHub project to report bugs <This message was edited>
2/13/25, 12:21 PM - Hafeez Shaikh Zaw: PTT-20250213-WA0023.opus (file attached)
2/13/25, 12:32 PM - Rafey: Mashah Allah great insights. Love it 💚

We will be using Shadcn due to its performance and minimalist design.

Please start creating folder structure. I will create tickets
2/13/25, 12:34 PM - Rafey: And for backed NestJs and NodeJs is okay? We have to eventually serve billions of requests.

What do you folks think? <This message was edited>
2/13/25, 12:35 PM - Zain Ul Abdeen ReactNative Zaw: Perfect.
2/13/25, 12:38 PM - Hafeez Shaikh Zaw: Backend team will guide better on this
2/13/25, 12:51 PM - Rafey: PTT-20250213-WA0025.opus (file attached)
2/13/25, 12:58 PM - Rafey: Create folders and reusable classes in such a way under *sdk* folder or as npm packages so that they can be unit tested independently and can be reused in

1. Zawjen
2. Zawjen admin 
3. Zawjen mobile app
4. More apps and websites in future
2/13/25, 1:00 PM - Rafey: Anyone?
2/13/25, 1:12 PM - Salman Zafar BE Php TS Zaw: Node Express JS is fine..
2/13/25, 1:15 PM - Farukh React Zaw: Yes node js with express or nest js both are good options
2/13/25, 1:16 PM - Rafey: Thanks for your feedback Salman Bhai.

For our use case of billions of requests, performance and testibility we have to consider a few things.


When comparing Express.js and NestJS for REST API development, considering performance, scalability, and testability is crucial. Express.js is a lightweight, unopinionated framework that offers maximum flexibility and is ideal for small to medium projects where simplicity and speed matter. However, as applications grow, managing scalability, structure, and maintainability becomes challenging. NestJS, built on top of Express (or Fastify for better performance), provides a modular and opinionated architecture, built-in dependency injection, TypeScript support, and native microservices compatibility, making it better suited for large-scale applications.

From a performance standpoint, Express has lower overhead and is slightly faster for simple APIs, but NestJS with Fastify can outperform it while retaining a well-structured framework. In terms of testability, NestJS has a significant advantage—it comes with built-in support for unit testing, integration testing, and dependency injection, making it easier to mock dependencies and write isolated, maintainable tests using Jest or other testing frameworks. Express, being unopinionated, requires additional setup and third-party libraries for proper test coverage.

Overall, if you need a quick and flexible solution, Express is great, but for scalability, maintainability, built-in testability, and enterprise-grade APIs, NestJS is the better choice. <This message was edited>
2/13/25, 1:22 PM - Rafey: We will heavily write unit tests using Jest etc. everywhere web, mobile, frontend and backend.

PR without 100% coverage will not be accepted

2/13/25, 1:49 PM - Rafey: All of these are really great insights. Love all of them. I will connect during weekends to discuss more in retro.
2/13/25, 1:50 PM - Farukh React Zaw: InshaAllah
2/13/25, 1:50 PM - Rafey: By the way 12pm Sat bi-weekly retro meeting time suits to everyone or we should change it?

As you can see the UX is like searching and filtering a car or a property 

Our UX should be very very clean, like an article on a white paper. People naturally read the most Green information first if they choose. They can remove the dataset from that result research paper from filters or add if they like and without page reload article will be updated. Our UX will be like a medium article sincerely explaining the concepts or at worst like a Wikipedia showing information in heading.
2/13/25, 6:18 PM - Rafey: Our web UX should be mobile first
2/13/25, 6:30 PM - Salman Zafar BE Php TS Zaw: Thanks for your detailed response @923232362208 Bhai. You’ve made some valid points, especially regarding scalability, structure, and testability in large-scale applications.

Express.js is great for flexibility and simplicity, making it a solid choice for many projects. But I agree that for billions of requests, a more structured and scalable framework like NestJS (especially with Fastify) could be beneficial. The built-in dependency injection and testability features definitely make NestJS a strong contender for enterprise-level applications.

That said, from my experience, I’ve built high-traffic applications using Express.js, Laravel, and Symfony, some of which handle 100K+ daily active users with tons of requests efficiently. Proper architecture, caching strategies, and optimized database queries play a huge role in handling large-scale traffic, even with Express.js.

At the end of the day, it depends on the team’s expertise and project requirements. If the focus is on maintainability, structured architecture, and long-term scaling, NestJS is a great pick. If speed, minimal setup, and full control over architecture are priorities, Express.js still holds its ground.
2/13/25, 6:38 PM - Rafey: Love it 💚. Thanks for the great insights. 

As training people in an open source project may takes time so 100% test coverage is important. NestJs provide this out of box.

But you are right you can scale anything express, larvel. It is just how much $1 scales you. Is it 100 users or 10K users?

I believe in hybrid set of micro services. Some in Go, Python due to AI or performance reasons and others in express or NestJs.

Let's start with NestJs as it has good  performance and testibility
2/13/25, 6:39 PM - Rafey: Zawjen website should has mobile first UX.

According to recent data, around 58% of people access websites via mobile devices, while the remaining 42% access through desktops, meaning a significant majority of internet users now browse primarily on their smartphones. 

95.8% use mobile phones to access the internet. By comparison, almost 62.9% use laptops or desktops (Source: Statista). 4. In Q1 2023, global internet users spent 56.8% of their online time on mobile phones, showing an increase from the 54.7% spent in Q4 2021 (Source: Statista).
2/13/25, 6:55 PM - Salman Zafar BE Php TS Zaw: Glad you liked it!  You’re absolutely right—100% test coverage is crucial, especially when onboarding contributors in an open-source project.

And yes, scalability isn’t just about tech. it’s also about cost efficiency. The “$1 scales 100 users or 10K users” perspective is spot on. Optimizing performance while balancing costs is key, and a hybrid microservices approach makes total sense. leveraging Go or Python for AI/performance-intensive tasks while using Express or NestJS where they fit best.

Looking forward to seeing how it all comes together!
2/13/25, 7:01 PM - Rafey: I would want NextJs SSG capabilities to not let hit my backend. Our blazing fast CDN should return  cached research papers on filters and questions. If our blazing fast HTML cache can't serve our user, then it will hit our Dollar intensive backend infra.

It will hit Redis cache which will cost us dollars/GB

It will hit MongoDB CPU/RAM/Disk IO which will cost us dollars/IO, CPU

And worst it will hit our Postgres SQL cluster, which has really costly DiskIO as compared to NoSQL or CDN.

And even worst if our developer forgot pagination on data or indexing on tables then SQL table scan could empty even deep pockets.

So I would prefer everything is served at the highest layer preferably NextJS SSG CDN

2/13/25, 7:51 PM - Rafey: Fun Fact: A fun fact about books dataset is that a same books title in different year or century or country have different contents. So our job is not done if we have a dataset for a book. We should keep adding old and exact datasets and new and fabricated datasets in different years, different century, different country/city or publisher
2/13/25, 7:51 PM - Rafey: So a same books could have 73 datasets or 173 or 1730 datasets!
2/13/25, 8:10 PM - Rafey: The good thing is that in our system most of data is static. So we can do all analytics on our laptop and upload it. A  book published by a specific publisher on a specific date is a static thing. 

Only Filters and Questions are dynamic.

At any given time our system is static data may it be 1 million or 10 million datasets

2/13/25, 8:21 PM - Hugo Mobile Zaw: I'd like some help since I'm not being able to follow all the languages spoken here. As far as I've understood, about react native app, I don't see still any requirement for native features like camera access, gestures... So, how good/worse would it be to get the mobile first version of the next js web application and get it through webview to the react native app? Does it sound good? I don't know if anyone has already given this idea
2/13/25, 8:33 PM - Rafey: Love the idea 💚 At the end of the day we will be using mobile features especially mic, camera and GPS

WebView is a great idea as we will be writing mobile first website. Let's explore more
2/13/25, 8:37 PM - Farukh React Zaw: I think flutter is better than React Native performance wise as per my company mobile team lead.
2/13/25, 8:39 PM - Rafey: And apologies for the Urdu language that we use sometimes 😊.  Hugo is from Brazil and speaks Spanish I believe
2/13/25, 8:41 PM - Rafey: Yes right 👍

In game development performance is crucial.

For us calling a few dozen REST APIs, same TypeScript will help eventually.

What do you think 🤔
2/13/25, 8:45 PM - Rafey: If you check medium.com on your mobile, we want that kind of friendly article explaining things kind of UX... 

We want an article like UX with a small rectangle somewhere that opens filters. Nothing else. Clean all over.

Very neat and clean UX. Non intrusive without visible controls. Any UX will become visible on hover.
2/13/25, 9:05 PM - Mohammed Usama ReactNative Zaw: Yes, both TypeScript and Dart are good options as type-safe languages, and we can choose either to achieve our desired goals for Zawjen.

2/13/25, 10:24 PM - Rafey: Let's keep things simple then. As we have TypeScript in the backend keeping the same in web and mobile will increase reusable, tested code. Same lint, same skills, same jest, same toolset, same dev and debug tools, same libraries.

You have pointed out important ranking fact. Love them all. ❤️Keep heading structure, meta tags and other in page SEO checklist intact, boost ranking.

For effective page SEO, focus on high-quality, relevant content that naturally includes target keywords without overstuffing. Use a compelling title tag (under 60 characters) and a meta description (150-160 characters) to improve click-through rates. Ensure a clear URL structure with relevant keywords. Implement header tags (H1, H2, H3) for readability and keyword optimization. Optimize images with alt text and compress them for faster loading. Prioritize mobile-friendliness, as Google ranks mobile-first. Improve page speed using caching, minification, and a CDN. Use internal linking for better navigation and backlinks from authoritative sites to boost credibility. Finally, ensure a secure (HTTPS) and user-friendly experience to enhance rankings.
2/13/25, 11:03 PM - Rafey: Should we create a template project for React? So we can create new web projects quickly. Right now we have 2 web projects 

1. Zawjen 
2. Zawjen admin site

For backend we must create a micro service template project because it will contain docker and kuberneets manifest file. Using Linux alpine.

All micro service projects will start with ms- like  ms-{service-name}.

Can anyone create frontend, backend, mobile template projects? I will create tickets 

All template repos will be named as  tem-{project name}
2/13/25, 11:03 PM - Vq Moid iqbal: for frontend we should also have microfrontend.
2/13/25, 11:04 PM - Vq Moid iqbal: each service should have its frontend, tab ja k microservice ka sahi advantage milayga
2/13/25, 11:14 PM - Rafey: Nice thought Moid Bhai on maintainability and faster independent releases. Love it ❤️

But this microfrontends architecture really shines in ERP or CRM kind of applications where you have hundreds of independent modules and dozens of delivery teams.

In our case we have a tool with question text box, a filter and an article canvas. That all.

Microfrontends are a powerful approach for large, modular applications, but they introduce complexity in our usecase. As our project doesn’t require independent deployments, a monolithic frontend is simpler and faster. Also microfrontends can introduce latency. Beside ensuring seamless communication and styling consistency between microfrontends can be tricky. If not optimized, multiple microfrontends can lead to increased HTTP requests and slower load times.

Perhaps the most trickiest of all is managing multiple microfrontends requires additional infrastructure (routing, state management). <This message was edited>
2/13/25, 11:18 PM - Rafey: Microservices architecture is to ensure scalability or QPS. 

While microfrontends are not for QPS.
2/13/25, 11:33 PM - Rafey: Thanks, that you learn a few things from me but I also learn a few things from you. We discuss. Do cost benefit analysis for our usecase and move forward. Although I will moderate, we will discuss as long as we are not satisfied with cost benefit.

We will do POC if we are doubtful about performance or ease of use etc.
2/13/25, 11:35 PM - Rafey: آپ سب کے لیے شعبان اس خاص رات میں خوب ہمت صلاحیت جذبے اور اعلی ایمان کی دعا ہے۔ اللہ آپ سب کو سلامتی اور عافیت کے سائے میں رکھے
2/13/25, 11:51 PM - Rafey: As QPS or Query Per Second testing is important for us, developers should learn to use following 

For databases, use pgbench (PostgreSQL), esrally (Elasticsearch)

For APIs/web apps, use JMeter, k6, or wrk. I would prefer k6 as we can use it in CICD. It is a  modern, scriptable load testing tool with great real-time results.

Also playwright for test automation. Playwright is mainly used for end-to-end (E2E) testing, UI automation testing, and browser-based performance testing.

We need to automate QPS and E2E. Preferably in CICD.
2/14/25, 5:25 AM - Abdullah Syed Ahmed FS MERN Zaw: I feel that this is a time-consuming project, and technology is changing rapidly. If we use Shadcn, a better UI library may come in the future, we have to refactor the code, .y point is, shouldn't we just use Tailwind or raw CSS instead? Just a thought.

Baqi ap sbko Shab-e-Barat Mubarak❣️ Allah is project ko kambyab kry Ameen
2/14/25, 6:58 AM - Rafey: I love when people drill down choices, like you did, to clarify the rational and impact. It stops us from over engineering or under engineering.

Love your thoughts 💚

Like NextJs, or NestJs we could start with jQuery, NodeJs and vanilla JavaScript and that is fine in some usecase where we need extreme flexibility and customizations. And in some cases we do.

I used C++ Web Assembly in my React component in one of the recent projects to ensure encryption code stays fast and hidden inside C while running in browser.

In our user case of search, filter and article canvas we do need flexibility but we also need UX and design common language across all frontend developers for better code maintainability and speed of development.

Shadcn accelerates development and ensures design consistency, while Tailwind/raw CSS offers flexibility and future-proofing. It ultimately depends on our long-term vision—speed and efficiency vs. full customization and control.

Without a structured component system, maintaining a consistent design may be harder. Shadcn or AntD at least give a point to start.

With Tailwind every component must be styled from scratch, increasing development time. We will be using buttons, cards etc. in zawjen and it's admin site anyways.

Tailwind requires more effort to design and maintain a consistent UI.

Shadcn has no extra dependencies, leading to a potentially smaller bundle size.

We built with what is available. You are right If a better UI library emerges, refactoring may be required.

But right now it reduces effort in designing and styling from scratch. It saves development time by providing ready-made, styled components.

we can seamlessly use Tailwind CSS alongside Shadcn because Shadcn itself is built with Tailwind in mind. The components in Shadcn are unstyled by default and can be easily customized using Tailwind classes. This allows us to leverage both the structure of Shadcn and the flexibility of Tailwind without any conflicts.

Explore Shadcn and Tailwind code like in image below. Shadcn provides a base Button component that we can extend using Tailwind.

What are your thoughts guys 🤔🤔🤔

2/14/25, 1:44 PM - Rafey: At *Zawjen* we will follow some of practices in open-source teams like *Linux, Node.js* projects

1. Many open-source projects work on a volunteer basis, meaning developers pick issues they want to work on rather than being assigned.

2. Core maintainers oversee priorities, review code, and sometimes actively assign tasks to trusted contributors.

3. For major changes, contributors write detailed proposals (RFCs) outlining the problem, solution, and impact.

4. Every pull request is checked by Continuous Integration (CI) tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins. Tests include unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks.

2/15/25, 4:54 PM - Farukh React Zaw: Nice documentation
2/15/25, 4:57 PM - Farukh React Zaw: You mentioned few points for Unit Testing I think according to my experience yarn is faster than npm.
2/15/25, 5:04 PM - Rafey: right, just for default use. But yarn is faster due to parallel installs & caching. Also it has cleaner, more readable output with a supports offline installs

Could you update document for yarn. Or I will do as I get time.

Love your suggestion. Thanks for making install time shorter and cleaner  ❤️❤️❤️

2/15/25, 9:58 PM - Hugo Mobile Zaw: Hello, I've joined some discussions
https://github.com/orgs/zawjen/discussions/2
https://github.com/orgs/zawjen/discussions/7
2/15/25, 10:01 PM - Rafey: Great Hugo. You can ask any clarification there by @ tagging me or anyone else
2/15/25, 10:03 PM - Rafey: If people don't tag @ person in discussion usually you will not get a reply
2/16/25, 6:05 AM - Salman Zafar BE Php TS Zaw: I will suggest to use pnpm as its more efficient and faster than yarn and npm.
2/16/25, 6:14 AM - Farukh React Zaw: I will check
2/16/25, 6:17 AM - Abdullah Syed Ahmed FS MERN Zaw: Bun is also an option
2/16/25, 12:17 PM - Rafey: If monorepos are not a concern, the choice between npm, pnpm, Yarn, and Bun depends on speed, efficiency, and ecosystem stability. npm remains the default and is reliable, but it can be slower and less efficient with dependencies. Yarn offers better performance and security features like Plug’n’Play (PnP), but PnP can cause compatibility issues. pnpm, while excellent for monorepos, is still beneficial for regular projects due to its efficient dependency management, though its unique symlink structure may cause issues with some tools. Bun is the fastest, as it is built with Zig and acts as a runtime, test runner, and package manager, but it is still maturing and may have ecosystem gaps. If stability is the priority, npm or Yarn (without PnP) is a safe bet. If speed is the goal, Bun is worth considering, but for a balance of efficiency and compatibility, Yarn or pnpm (if tooling supports it) are strong choices.
2/16/25, 12:21 PM - Rafey: We will not be using monorepos.

We have one repo for web, admin, app and each cli and microservice to offer independence and scalability.

Monorepos offer several advantages, particularly for teams managing multiple related projects. They enable code sharing and reusability, ensuring that common libraries and components are used across projects without duplication. Dependency management becomes more consistent, as all projects share the same package versions, reducing compatibility issues. Atomic changes allow updates to shared packages across all projects in a single commit, ensuring synchronization. Additionally, monorepos simplify collaboration by allowing developers to work on multiple projects without switching repositories and make CI/CD management more centralized and efficient. However, monorepos also come with challenges. Large repositories can cause performance issues, slowing down Git operations, dependency installations, and even IDEs. Managing dependencies in a monorepo can be complex, requiring tools like pnpm workspaces, Yarn workspaces, or Nx. As the repository grows, scalability issues arise, making permission control, CI/CD configuration, and access management more difficult. A significant risk is that a breaking change in a shared package can cause failures across multiple projects. Additionally, tracking history for individual projects becomes harder, and some tools may not fully support monorepo structures, requiring extra configuration. Overall, monorepos are ideal for closely related projects with shared dependencies and frequent collaboration, but they may not be the best choice for independent projects with different lifecycles or scalability concerns.
2/16/25, 12:35 PM - Rafey: Thank you Zafar Bhai for insights. Do you have an insights on pnpm tooling issues. Also we will not be using monorepos. 

To manage a few hundred dependencies do you think *yarn* is sufficient?

web, admin, app, microservice projects will have somewhere between 50 to 500 dependencies or do you see it differently?
2/16/25, 12:43 PM - Rafey: Prayers for everyone participating in this Sadqah e Jareha or charity work that Allah blessings shower on him or her and the whole family. 

 *When a man dies, his acts come to an end, but three, recurring charity, or knowledge (by which people) benefit, or a pious son, who prays for him (for the deceased).*

2/16/25, 7:11 PM - Umar React Zaw: This message was deleted
2/16/25, 7:25 PM - Rafey: @923313339070 or anyone from React developers, are we planning to use some of these in *web-zawjen* repo? Any comments?

Next.js 15

Pros: Next.js 15 offers improved performance with optimized server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). The new App Router enhances server components, making data fetching more efficient and reducing client-side JavaScript. It's also backed by Vercel, ensuring continuous updates and strong community support.

Cons: The learning curve for the App Router and server components can be steep, especially for developers transitioning from older Next.js versions. Managing state in a server-heavy environment requires new patterns, which might not be intuitive at first.

React 19

Pros: React 19 brings better performance, improved concurrency features, and updates like Actions, which simplify form handling. It also enhances React Server Components (RSC), making full-stack development smoother.

Cons: Many libraries are still catching up with React 19's changes, meaning potential compatibility issues. Additionally, developers need to adapt to new patterns like Actions and RSC, which can be a shift from traditional React practices.

ShadCN UI

Pros: ShadCN UI provides beautifully designed, accessible components that are customizable without the usual bloat of UI frameworks like Material UI. Since it’s built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, it ensures flexibility and responsiveness.

Cons: While highly customizable, it requires familiarity with Tailwind CSS, which may be a drawback for those used to traditional CSS or component libraries with predefined styles. Additionally, integrating it into a design system may need extra setup.

TanStack Query

Pros: TanStack Query simplifies API calls by handling caching, background fetching, and automatic updates. It significantly reduces boilerplate compared to traditional state management solutions for fetching and storing remote data.

Cons: The mental shift from Redux or simple useState/useEffect patterns can be challenging. Overuse may lead to unnecessary complexity in cases where simple state management would suffice.

Motion React

Pros: Motion React (Framer Motion) is an elegant, easy-to-use animation library with great performance optimizations. It integrates well with React and allows for smooth, declarative animations without requiring deep knowledge of CSS animations.

Cons: While lightweight, it still adds some overhead to bundle size. Overusing animations can also affect performance, especially if not optimized properly.

React Hook Form

Pros: React Hook Form optimizes form management by minimizing re-renders and providing built-in validation. It’s lightweight and integrates well with other libraries, including UI frameworks and state management tools.

Cons: The API, while powerful, can be unintuitive for beginners. Complex forms may require additional learning to fully leverage features like field arrays and custom validations.

Overall Verdict

This stack is incredibly powerful for building modern web apps. However, it requires developers to stay updated with newer paradigms, especially with Next.js 15 and React 19 evolving rapidly. If used wisely, it provides a scalable, performant, and developer-friendly experience.
2/16/25, 11:30 PM - Hugo Mobile Zaw: I think that react 19 has just been released. I think it was yesterday when setting up the next js project, shadcn warned during installation that react 19 could cause some conflict with peer dependencies. So actually I'm using react 18
2/16/25, 11:37 PM - Hugo Mobile Zaw: Additionally, I'd rather use the new next js app router and other things it brings but by following our nextjs.md conventions I just had to set it up like the older days. It still works.
2/17/25, 1:52 AM - Rafey: Great insights

2/17/25, 9:12 AM - Rafey: What will be agenda of meeting? Next 18 vs 19?

Usually in open source projects, people do discussions like we do on GitHub. You can @  tag me, Hugo and a few others who participated in the discussion earlier.

I hope you understand that in any large scale, remote teams there could be potentially 100s of technical topics people would like discussion and decision and online meeting may not always be possible.

What are your thoughts 🤔.
2/17/25, 9:21 AM - Rafey: Make sure we discuss and take decisions that  motivates you, inspires you, empowers you and above all it is taken with love, great care and sincerely 😊😊😊

Instead you can toggle checkbox. With a hyperlink you can still clear the filter which will remove everything from filter controls including filter checkbox.

This will help user to see the effect or including or excluding one of hundreds of filters.

Later we will add a text box at the top of all filters to find specific filter from hundreds of filters. 🌸

2/20/25, 1:50 AM - Rafey: If someone is experienced but is not Sincere overall or is not aligned with the vision to spread Sincerity, he or she should not become a leader at Zawjen.

As all new leaders at Zawjen will get the recommendation from earlier leaders to be added in the leadership committee, so it is vital to choose Wise and  Sincere leaders.

Technical skills are important at Zawjen, but not the reason to be a leader. Do not select a leader based on experience or technical skills. It is the deep Sincerity of a person that should make you vote and elect leaders.

I pray that everyone here stay blessed 🌸

2/22/25, 6:44 PM - Rafey: *Life is not meant to be lived as a spectator.*

Imagine standing at the edge of a vast desert, the sand slipping through your fingers like time itself. Every grain lost is a moment gone, never to return. If we assume we will live for 80 years, and we are already 25, that leaves us with just 55 years to create something meaningful, to give back to the world, or to leave behind a legacy as Sadaqah Jariyah—a charity that benefits even after our passing.

If you are 30, you have 50 years left, meaning around 8 years of truly productive time. If you are 40, you have 40 years left, which gives you about 7 years. If you are 50, you have only 30 years left, leaving you with just 5 years to dedicate to meaningful work. Time moves fast, and every passing decade takes away opportunities to build something meaningful.

Now, let’s see how much of that time is truly available for meaningful work. A day has 24 hours, but between sleep, prayers, eating, family obligations, and the many small duties of life, we are left with roughly one-third of the day—just 8 hours—to truly dedicate to work.

If we apply the same fraction to our remaining years, one-third of 55 years is just 18 years.

Weekends are another factor. Typically, we don’t work for the full 8 hours on weekends. If we assume that we work only 70% of the weekdays' hours, that brings our effective working time down. 70% of 18 years leaves us with roughly 12.6 years. And since we don’t fully rest on weekends either, let’s assume we work 6 hours instead of 8. That’s 75% of a full workday.

So, instead of the initial 18 years, when we factor in partial work on weekends, our true available time shrinks further. The final calculation? Around 9 years.

Nine years out of a lifetime of 80.

Now, ask yourself: is that enough? Is it enough to build a legacy, to help others, to achieve the dreams we keep postponing? The sand is slipping. We don’t have time to merely watch.

*Life is not meant to be lived as a spectator. This is what Zawjen is all about.*

I pray that you stay blessed. Ameen 🌸

2/23/25, 2:53 PM - Rafey: اسلام وعلیکم 

بعض اوقات انسان کا برا عمل اس کو پھانسی تک لے جاتا ہے۔ بعض اوقات واقعی اعلان حق کی وجہ سے شہادت ہو جاتی ہے۔ اس لیے سمجھداری سے چلیں۔ Zawjen  کے معاملات نازک ہیں۔

ہم صرف 7 ڈکشنری اور 8 اسماء الرجال کی کتابوں میں  احادیث کے راویوں کے بارے میں رائے ہے اس کو ویب سائٹ اور ایپ پر لا رہے ہیں۔ 

You might be referring to the case of Imam Abu Rayyah or Muhammad al-Ghazali—modern scholars who were criticized for questioning the authenticity of some Hadith in Sahih Bukhari. However, historically, the most famous execution related to Hadith criticism was Imam Yahya ibn Ma'in or Imam Ibn al-Madini, but they were not executed.

One of the closest cases is Muhammad ibn Sa'd al-Zuhri, who was reportedly punished for his views on Hadith. Another case is Imam Nazzam, a Mu'tazilite scholar, who rejected certain Hadiths and faced severe opposition. However, if you are referring to someone executed specifically for identifying weak Hadiths in Bukhari, there is no well-documented case of this in classical history.
2/23/25, 2:53 PM - Rafey: Imam Mahmoud Abu Rayyah (1889–1970) was an Egyptian scholar known for his critical views on Hadith, particularly Sahih Bukhari and narrators like Abu Huraira (RA). In his book "Adwa' Ala al-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah" (Lights on the Prophetic Sunnah), he questioned the authenticity of some Hadiths, arguing that political influences, especially during the Umayyad era, shaped certain reports. His work sparked backlash from Al-Azhar scholars, who accused him of distorting Islamic traditions, though he was not executed.

Similarly, Sheikh Muhammad al-Ghazali (1917–1996), a prominent Egyptian scholar, advocated for a rational approach to Hadith interpretation. In "Al-Sunnah al-Nabawiyyah bayn Ahl al-Fiqh wa Ahl al-Hadith" (The Prophetic Sunnah Between the Scholars of Fiqh and Hadith Scholars), he criticized the blind acceptance of certain Hadiths, arguing that some contradicted the Quran’s essence. His reformist stance made him controversial, but unlike Abu Rayyah, he remained respected within Al-Azhar.

While both scholars faced intense opposition, there is no recorded case of execution solely for criticizing Hadith in Bukhari. Some earlier scholars, like Jahm ibn Safwan, were executed, but their cases were more related to theological disputes rather than Hadith authenticity. If you recall any other specific name or source mentioning an execution, I can help track it down.
2/24/25, 1:10 PM - Rafey: Our work with the Quran and Hadith is highly sensitive and requires the utmost care, sincerity, and precision. Every aspect, from Arabic OCR and website scraping to JSON dataset creation and UX design, must maintain absolute accuracy.

It is crucial that not a single letter, زیر (Kasrah), زبر (Fatha), پیش (Dammah), or any diacritical mark is changed, skipped, or misplaced. Even the slightest alteration can lead to significant errors in meaning and interpretation.

Let’s ensure that every technical and design decision upholds this responsibility with the highest level of diligence. Your dedication to this precision is deeply appreciated.
2/24/25, 4:38 PM - Rafey: Although Zawjen.net is focused on Sincerity, an act of heart, the world around us is focusing on brain, so should we too. Neuralink and Meta Brain typing are BCI. Now Chinese researchers have built the world’s first two-way brain-computer interface (BCI). Unlike conventional BCIs that just decode brain signals, this system creates a feedback loop where both the brain and the machine learn from each other and improve at working together over time.
2/24/25, 7:04 PM - Rafey: Zawjen is a charity work. Your family and job has more priority Zawjen issues have. 

Even if you assign issues to yourself and after a month or 6 months you find you are unable to spare time to do this charity work, it is OK.

All you need to do is to sincerely delegate the work to another person who is willing to do that work. 

Your only commitment to stay sincere. You are not bound to complete work in 1, 2 or 6 months. If you can complete it that is wonderful and Allah will reward you for your kind Sincerity. If you cannot complete it, may be someone else will understand that issue from you. That is why it is important to discuss issues as GitHub comments.

I pray that everyone here stays blessed 🌸

We need to create dataset management screens *Specs* and  requirements

So right. Don't live the life of dumb person. 🙂🙂🙂
2/24/25, 10:18 PM - Farukh React Zaw: You are right I am not against of AI now a days I am using very little bit AI tools like chat gpt and cursor installed recently.
2/24/25, 10:37 PM - Rafey: In 1996, I went to Dr. Adul Qadir Computer Exhibition held among University students of Pakistan.

I used C on DOS operating system to plot string equations input as 2D graph.

A researcher and a PhD at Kahota asked me why you have not used Windows? I said DOS is good enough and will stay. 🙆‍♂️

He smiled ☺️ at a 22 year old engineer and said we had the same thoughts about ICs while we were very used to of using Vacuum Tubes Thermionic Tubes in 1960s.
2/24/25, 10:47 PM - Farukh React Zaw: The context of this YouTube video that I have shared for realization to use AI tools limited way to maintain brain thinking power mostly explore documentations, check google and stack overflow. There is no problem for experienced developers.
2/24/25, 11:05 PM - Rafey: Even if you write code on your own, ask AI to find logical and security bugs before submitting a PR.

Also if you are reviewing a PR ask AI to find security issues and logic bugs.

AI is just a code completion on steroids.
2/24/25, 11:27 PM - Farukh React Zaw: Your suggestion is valuable for point of security even no issue in this case for example I have depth understanding of JavaScript and how things are working behind the scene like V8 Engine, execution context, heap memory, call stack further more TypeScript code conversion into JavaScript etc. In the end browser only understand the HTML and CSS, JavaScript. if me or other developer is understanding the code from Chat Gpt and implementing solution in code this is fine without the understanding of code copy and paste in the code it is dangerous thing.
2/25/25, 12:33 AM - Farukh React Zaw: I will share more things in the format of diagrams for the Database schema of backend.
2/25/25, 12:36 AM - Farukh React Zaw: I am doing some planning in my mind with brain storming.
2/25/25, 3:04 AM - Rafey: That's great! 

Copy paste without understanding is dangerous

LLMs are known to generate hallucination, or wrong imaginary answers.

Try ChatGPT Reason feature for better results. But beware of hallucinations.

LLMs as of now are not a replacement of deep understanding and knowledge of language or framework. So it can only help in 

1. Big chunk of code completion or class/component writing that you don't want to waste time
2. Explain someone code
3. Find bugs
4. Find security bugs
5. Find performance bugs

While investing your time in coding, keep a check 

1. If you are doing it as a *brain tease* only or doing it to make some progress.
2. Most tech knowledge gets obsolete 
3. Most algorithms written in system level software e.g. operating systems, databases etc. and university thesis go unutilized. No one needs them. Human problems are much much simpler than brain tease offered at https://www.algoexpert.io

A well rounded personality usually has knowledge in several disciplines of life. So reading books on a variety of subjects including programming, algorithms, fiction, physics, literature, poetry, etc. may be the right use of human life.
2/25/25, 3:04 AM - Rafey: Sure.

یاد ہے طرزِ تخاطب میں بزرگوں کے لئے
قبلہ و کعبہ کے اَلقاب ہوا کرتے تھے

کاش دنیا میں مَحَبت کے سِوا کچھ بھی نہ ہو
یاد ہے آنکھ میں کیا خواب ہوا کرتے تھے

وہ تو ساحِل کی طرح آپ مِلے تھے ورنہ
میری قسمت میں تو گرداب ہوا کرتے تھے

2/25/25, 3:09 PM - Farukh React Zaw: How many number of tables will use in database by using PostgreSQL with Nest JS for API's? <This message was edited>
2/25/25, 3:21 PM - Razi Ur Rehman: @923232362208 bhai is right person to answer this..
2/25/25, 3:27 PM - Farukh React Zaw: Yes I am asking from him
2/25/25, 3:34 PM - Rafey: tables?

First identify the data in our system.

Then classify as SQL or No SQL based on ACID needs.

Then identify volume of data.

Then decide shards and replicas

Then if it's SQL decide which tables it will use. Relationship. Indexes etc.

We have to complete data architecture in this ticket

https://github.com/zawjen/organization/issues/19

And one more for NoSQL.

For example Datasets will be in ElasticSearch.

Read 100 Billion book blog post

2/25/25, 10:25 PM - Rafey: We need Prisma ORM for SQL database migration process. ElasticSearch is schema less so only need TypeScript.

Prisma ORM and Its Migrate Process

Prisma is a modern ORM for Node.js and TypeScript that provides a type-safe, database-first approach to working with relational databases like PostgreSQL. It simplifies database interactions through its intuitive Prisma Client, while Prisma Migrate handles schema migrations. Prisma Migrate allows developers to define changes in a schema.prisma file and generate migration scripts using prisma migrate dev for development or prisma migrate deploy for production. It automatically creates versioned migration files, ensuring smooth schema upgrades and rollbacks. To downgrade, developers can use prisma migrate resolve to roll back to a previous migration, preserving data integrity. For seeding data, Prisma provides a prisma db seed command that runs a custom script, allowing developers to populate databases with test or initial data easily.

Elasticsearch ORM and Its Upgrade, Downgrade, and Seed Process

Unlike relational databases, Elasticsearch does not have a traditional ORM, but developers interact with it using the official Elasticsearch Node.js client (@elastic/elasticsearch) or libraries like Elasticsearch ORM (elastic-orm), which offer a structured way to query data. Since Elasticsearch is schema-less, upgrading an index involves creating a new versioned index (e.g., products_v2), using the Reindex API to copy data from the old index, and switching an alias to the new index. Downgrading follows the same process, reindexing data back to the previous version. Seeding data is done via the Bulk API, which allows inserting multiple documents in a single request, making it efficient for initial data population. Since indices cannot be modified like SQL tables, schema changes require index recreation, making versioning essential for Elasticsearch migrations.

2/26/25, 12:05 AM - Farukh React Zaw: Three categories of UI/UX design we can focus on for research:

1) Website
2) Admin Panel
3) Mobile App

These categories may be updated in the future.
2/26/25, 6:44 AM - Rafey: Mashah Allah. 

Also, check various clear Arabic fonts as used in equran library, analyze Quran, and many other websites and apps.

 *Important*

Later we will implement following. I will create a ticket for this but design has margin for it as well as RTL/LTR

1. User on our website and app can choose from dozens of fonts for *each* language. So there will be 10 fonts for Arabic, 12 fonts for English etc.

2. We will offer content in 1000 languages. Including Chinese, Pushto, Bangali, Hindi, Pushto, Urdu, Arabic, English.
2/26/25, 6:45 AM - Rafey: May Allah bless you and give you all the energy needed to do this charity work. 🌸

2/26/25, 6:53 AM - Rafey: IMG-20250226-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
I also used this website often. Nice UX.

This website UX is intended to listen Audio and read translation. Or just read Quran like as Tilawah.

Our UX will be used for QnA, filter Dataset and reach to the conclusion about truth with selected datasets.

We will focus more on words,people, order of green references in order of score
2/26/25, 6:55 AM - Rafey: Our UX should be clean with one ... on the corner for all *Actions*. The web and app surface will be used to show Datasets in the clean Article like format. Just like perplexity.ai

2/26/25, 1:16 PM - Rafey: Zawjen is far less of a charity than what you do for your own family or office.

I said it because The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said:

"The best of dinar (money) a man spends is the dinar he spends on his family, the dinar he spends on his riding beast for the sake of Allah, and the dinar he spends on his companions for the sake of Allah."
(Sahih Muslim 994)

2/26/25, 4:12 PM - Rafey: I am working for Bolder Group, a large investment governance company.

Recently I have to reverse engineer Laraval code base to generate SOAP API documentation that it is using.

I start asking questions to cursor AI and ChatGPT about code.

I was able to reverse engineer and document complete markdown files in 5 days for

1. 13 SOAP API 
2. 24 Wrapper API
3. 6 date formats
4. Over 100 request and response parameters with their data types, which APIs are using them, possible values, format

If I have to write such a markdown alone while analyzing code on my own, it could 2 to 4 weeks to correctly reverse engineer and document such complex  code.

Now I will ask AI to write .NET Core C# API code to be used by PowerApps and React

I hope this will be helpful for Zawjen team as well for analysis and documentation

رمضان المبارک کے چاند سے متعلق سپارکو نے پیش گوئی کر دی۔

ترجمان سپارکو کے مطابق نیا چاند 28 فروری 2025 کو پاکستان کے معیاری وقت کے مطابق پانچ بج کر 45 منٹ پر ہو گا اور غروب افتاب کے وقت چاند کی عمر 12 گھنٹے ہوگی۔

28 فروری کو غروب آفتاب کے وقت چاند کی عمر 12 گھنٹے اور بلندی 5 ڈگری ہو گی، چاند کی کم بلندی اور فاصلے کی وجہ سے ہلال کا نظر آنا مشکل ہے۔ چاند اور سورج کا زاویائی فاصلہ7 ڈگری ہوگا جس کی وجہ سے ہلال انسانی  آنکھ سے نظر نہیں آئے گا۔


پاکستان میں رمضان المبارک 2 مارچ 2025  سے شروع ہونے کا امکان ہے۔

سعودی عرب میں 28 فروری کو ہلال نظر آسکتا ہے سعودی عرب میں  رمضان یکم مارچ سے شروع ہوگا۔

ترجمان نے واضح کیا کہ رمضان کے چاند کی رویت کا حتمی فیصلہ رویت ہلال کمیٹی کے پاس ہے۔

رویت ہلال

رمضان المبارک 1446 ہجری کا چاند دیکھنے کےلئے مرکزی رویت ہلال کمیٹی کا اجلاس طلب کرلیا گیا ہے۔ رمضان کا چاند دیکھنے کے لئے مرکزی رویت ہلال کمیٹی کا اجلاس 28 فروری کو پشاور میں ہوگا۔

چئیرمین مرکزی رویت ہلال کمیٹی مولانا عبدالخبیر آزاد اجلاس کی صدارت کریں گے۔ وزارت مذہبی امور کا کہنا تھا کہ زونل رویت ہلال کمیٹیاں اپنے متعلقہ مقامات پر اجلاس کریں گی، چاند نظر آنے یا نہ آنے کا اعلان مرکزی کمیٹی کرے گی، اجلاس کے انتظامات وزارت مذہبی امور کے تحت ہوں گے۔

محکمہ موسمیات

محکمہ موسمیات کا کہنا ہے کہ پاکستان میں ماہ رمضان کا چاند28 فروری کو نظر آنے کا امکان نہیں ہے تاہم ملک بھر میں پہلاروزہ 2 مارچ کو ہوگا۔

ذرائع محکمہ موسمیات کے مطابق چاند کی پیدائش28فروری کو5بج کر45منٹ پر ہوگی، غروب آفتاب کے وقت چاند کی عمر13گھنٹے 12منٹ ہوگی۔

ذرائع محکمہ موسمیات کا کہنا ہے کہ اسلامی ماہ کا چاند دکھائی دینے کیلئے اس کی عمر 19گھنٹے ہونا ضروری ہے۔ محکمہ موسمیات نے کہا کہ 29 شعبان کو مطلع کہیں صاف اور کہیں بادل چھائے رہنے کا امکان ہے۔

سعودی عرب، خلیجی ممالک

سعودی عرب اور خلیجی ممالک میں رمضان 2025 یکم مارچ سے شروع ہونے کا امکان ہے۔ ماہرین فلکیات کے مطابق زیادہ تر اسلامی ممالک میں یکم مارچ بروز ہفتہ سے رمضان 2025 کا آغاز متوقع ہے۔

ابوظہبی میں قائم بین الاقوامی فلکیاتی مرکز نے بتایا کہ اسلامی ممالک جمعہ 28 فروری کو بابرکت مہینے کے آغاز کے موقع پر رمضان کا چاند دیکھیں گے۔

ماہرین فلکیات نے مزید کہا کہ عین فلکیاتی حسابات کی بنیاد پر، ہفتہ 1 مارچ 2025 کو رمضان کا پہلا دن ہونے کی توقع ہے تاہم حتمی فیصلہ چاند نظر آنے کے بعد کیا جائے گا۔

مرکز کے چیئرمین محمد عودہ نے کہا کہ ہلال مغربی ایشیا، بیشتر افریقہ اور جنوبی یورپ میں دوربینوں کے ذریعے نظر آئے گا، جب کہ اسے امریکہ کے بڑے حصوں میں کھلی آنکھوں سے دیکھا جا سکتا ہے۔

رمضان، اسلامی قمری تقویم کا نواں مہینہ اور ایک مقدس وقت ہے جب دنیا بھر کے مسلمان صبح سے غروب آفتاب تک روزہ رکھتے ہیں، کھانے پینے اور دیگر جسمانی ضروریات سے پرہیز کرتے ہیں۔

29 یا 30، اس رمضان میں کتنے روزے ہوں گے

قمری یا اسلامی مہینے 29 یا 30 ایام پر مشتمل ہوتے ہیں ماہ رمضان کتنے روزوں پر مشتمل ہوگا اس ھوالے سے ماہر فلکیات نے پیشگوئی کی ہے۔
قمری یا اسلامی مہینوں کا آغاز رویت یا چاند پر منحصر ہوتا ہے اور یہ مہینے عیسوی مہینوں کے برعکس 29 یا 30 دنوں پر مشتمل ہوتے ہیں۔ ماہ رمضان المبارک کے آغاز میں صرف دو ہفتے باقی رہے گئے ہیں۔

متحدہ عرب امارات میں رواں سال ماہ رمضان المبارک کتنے ایام (روزوں) پر مشتمل ہوگا۔ اس حوالے سے ماہر فلکیات نے پیشگوئی کی ہے۔

فلکیاتی کمیٹی کے بورڈ آف ڈائریکٹرز کے چیئرمین اور عرب فضا و فلکیاتی فیڈریشن کے رکن ابراہیم الجروان کا کہنا ہے’ رواں برس رمضان المبارک 30 دن جبکہ روزے کا دورانیہ 13 گھنٹے کا ہوگا۔‘

امارات الیوم کے مطابق فلکیاتی کمیٹی کے بورڈ آف ڈائریکٹرز کے چیئرمین اور عرب فضا و فلکیاتی فیڈریشن کے رکن ابراہیم الجروان کا کہنا ہے رواں برس رمضان المبارک 30 دن پر مشتمل ہوگا اور روزے کا دورانیہ 13 گھنٹے ہوگا۔

انہوں نے مزید بتایا کہ امارات میں مشرقی علاقوں میں سحری اور افطاری کے اوقات مغربی علاقوں کے مقابلے میں 20 منٹ کا فرق ہوگا۔

الجروان کا مزید کہنا تھا’ جمعہ 28 فروری کی شام رمضان المبارک کا چاند دکھائی دینے کی قوی امید ہے، اس اعتبار سے یکم مارچ بروز ہفتہ یکم رمضان ہوگا۔

فلکیاتی حساب سے عید الفطر کا چاند 29 مارچ کو امارات کے وقت کے مطابق ہلال کی پیدائش 14:58 پر ہوگی جو غروب آفتاب سے پانچ منٹ بعد ہی ڈوب جائے گا۔

جس کی وجہ سے ہلال کا مشاہدہ کرنا ممکن نہیں ہوگا۔ اس طرح ماہ مبارک میں 30 روزے ہوں گے اورعید الفطر بروز پیر 31 مارچ کو ہوگی۔
2/28/25, 6:11 PM - Rafey: سب کو رمضان کی پیشگی مبارک باد۔ 🌸

دعا ہے کہ رمضان عافیت اور عبادات کی قبولیت کے ساتھ گزرے۔ 💕

3/1/25, 12:44 PM - Rafey: There are ways to become sincere.

1. At Zawjen, you can write a one minute blog post or Canva video, no matter how small of a thing  you learnt. e.g. install git, select between NextJs 18 or 19, NestJs, ElasticSearch, Process, UX design, Datasets
2. While giving money to some needy people, do not handover money. Ask them about what they do, their family, where they live, sons and daughters. Then handover money.

There should be a conscious effort to become Sincere.

May Allah bless you and your family 🌿🌿🌿
3/1/25, 1:02 PM - Rafey: A very good UX suggestion from @923352807751 about Storybook 

I used a Storybook in one of the financial product AARP Money Map. Because it was just one website without much reuse, developers often forget to update Storybook and it stays in a crashed state. So If not maintained properly, the Storybook version of components might differ from real app behavior.

The good thing about Storybook is that people across the world can Develop and test UI components in isolation without worrying about app dependencies. It has Powerful plugins like accessibility testing, viewport adjustments, and interaction testing. The best thing perhaps is that Designers and product managers can review components without needing to run the full app.

So skip Storybook if you're working on a simple project, a backend-heavy app, or if maintaining separate stories is too much overhead.

Use Storybook if you're working on a large-scale app like Zawjen, design system, or reusable UI library. It improves modularity and speeds up UI development. Zawjen is not a design system, or reusable UI library but with our efforts we can give world the best 
design system, or reusable UI library.

People around the world are seeing your open source work and your next great opportunity lies in building a great design system, or reusable UI library. 

Zawjen will have dozens and dozens of websites and apps eventually for internal and external use.

I recommend Storybook.
3/1/25, 2:02 PM - Rafey: This is how easy it is at zawjen.net to do charity and become sincere https://zawjen.net/2025/03/01/conscious-sincerity/

3/1/25, 4:22 PM - Rafey: https://zawjen.net/2025/03/01/stenciljs-or-not-to-stenciljs-at-zawjen/

As we are working on UX, we have various topics coming in.

One of our Frontend team volunteers from Brazil, *Hugo* Machado de Almeida wrote an excellent suggestion about StencilJs.com. It is a library for building reusable, scalable component libraries. The creator of the library claims that it generates small, blazing fast Web Components.

I hope Hugo can do a POC and share results in a blog post.

May Allah guide us in the right direction. Ameen 🌿🌿🌿

@923414285511 bhai is a seasoned frontend developer, and he suggested to do Zawjen Admin Panel using horizon-ui NextJs/Shadcn boilerplate. Earlier @923313339070 bhai suggested NextJs15/React19/Shadcn for better SEO, SSG, SSR.

I think most Admin panels look the same... 

1. A left hand side panel with menu accordion 
2. A right canvas to show anything. 
3. On top right usually, you have notifications and profile anchors or other important actions.

Does anyone have any input? Layout, Colors? Based on our vision we have to choose color for logos, site, WordPress etc.

https://horizon-ui.com/shadcn-nextjs-boilerplate/dashboard/settings
3/2/25, 5:30 PM - Farukh React Zaw: I will share color schemes
3/2/25, 5:34 PM - Farukh React Zaw: I am thinking about Green color
3/2/25, 5:35 PM - Farukh React Zaw: Green is an Islamic color
3/2/25, 6:06 PM - Rafey: IMG-20250302-WA0023.jpg (file attached)
There is a mention of green-colored garments in Surah Al Insan  76:21. Green looks calm and nature related color.

However in our web, admin and app we should have setting for green, light, dark just like Quran.com

It will help us to add more colors

3/2/25, 6:11 PM - Rafey: In Gulf countries there is a desert so they like Sepia a lot.

Similarly sky blue is a natural color.

We want to promote calmness, nature, Sincerity and knowledge through colors.

At the same time we want to give options to users.

Our app and websites will be used aside of sea, island, forest, mountains, rivers and desserts. Mostly outdoors
3/2/25, 7:27 PM - Farukh React Zaw: Yes good idea
3/4/25, 6:13 AM - Rafey: How are we planning to reuse classes between website, admin and mobile TypeScript code?
3/4/25, 10:46 AM - Rafey: Really good to call and talk with AI that has human like emotions

https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice
3/4/25, 11:05 AM - Rafey: I hope you know that x.ai or Gork use internet directly as oppose to ChatGPT which is trained for data until September 2022.

Here is our OCR prompt

AI that can do complex tasks for you — will add $6 Trillion to the global economy by 2030. 

Consider Zawjen Prism: It Compare your company’s developer productivity with industry peers to improve performance and efficiency.

After using AI for the last 2 years, I also feel that AI *augments* your deep knowledge of the subject and does not replace it.🌿
3/5/25, 11:01 PM - Farukh React Zaw: It is depends on the way how to use it
3/6/25, 5:56 AM - Rafey: Soon there will be people who will be asking $5000/month and completing work in 8h, and other people asking $5000/month and completing work in 2h using *AI* . The first group will be laid off. This could arrive by 2027 or as late as 2030. Earn and get promotions in 20 weeks using AI in 2025. Later, this will not be the case.
3/6/25, 11:04 PM - Rafey: As our vision is to spread Sincerity. Then what is Sincerity?

We will keep sharing from unlimited expressions of Sincerity. Here is one academic take:

اخلاص (Sincerity) کا مطلب ہے خلوصِ نیت، سچائی اور بے ریا ہونا۔ یہ اس کیفیت کو ظاہر کرتا ہے جس میں انسان اپنے قول، فعل اور ارادوں میں سچائی اور دیانت داری سے کام لیتا ہے، بغیر کسی دکھاوے یا بناوٹ کے۔ اخلاص کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ جو کچھ بھی کہا جائے یا کیا جائے، وہ حقیقی جذبات اور نیت کے مطابق ہو۔

اسلام میں اخلاص کی بڑی اہمیت ہے، خاص طور پر عبادات اور نیک اعمال میں۔ سچا اخلاص وہ ہے جس میں انسان کسی بھی کام کو محض اللہ کی رضا کے لیے کرے، نہ کہ لوگوں کی تعریف یا دنیاوی فائدے کے لیے۔

Sincerity is the quality of being genuine, truthful, and free from pretense or deceit. It involves being honest in one's intentions, actions, and words, and acting in accordance with one's true feelings and beliefs. In a broader sense, sincerity reflects a person's integrity and authenticity, especially in relationships, actions, and communication. In an Islamic context, sincerity (Ikhlas) holds a significant place, as it implies doing things purely for the sake of Allah, without seeking praise or approval from others.

Stay blessed 🌸🌸🌸
3/6/25, 11:17 PM - Rafey: Who is most sincere? Or role model for sincerity?

اللہ سب سے مخلص اور اسکے رسول محمد صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم سب سے مخلص اور فرمان بردار آل محمد صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم انکے بعد سب سے مخلص جو قیام قیامت تک اس دنیا میں موجود ہیں۔ لکھی ہوئی کتاب میں قرآن سب سے مخلصانہ پیغام۔

Allah is the most sincere, and His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the most sincere. The obedient family of Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the most sincere after him. Among those present in this world until the Day of Judgment, the most sincere are those who follow this path. The written book, the Quran, is the most sincere message.

Stay blessed 🌸🌸🌸
